# quiz

## Overview
A vueJs project to help me learn the basics of VueJS as I try to learn the newer JS frameworks.

The project is a simple quiz that asks a user 10 questions and keeps track of the answers they got correct, the number of questions answers as well as displaying a message in a modal when they reach the end of the quiz and allowing them to restart it. The quiz questions are provided by opentdb.com through their API.

Based on a tutorial from FreeCodeCamp which can be found here : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4deVCNJq3qc
